# ExecuTorch Llama iOS Demo App

This is the iOS demo app for the Llama project. We followed the official ExecuTorch iOS demo app tutorial to get the LLM running on mobile, then we integrated it with the Llam4rt project using Martin's assistant iOS app.

The XCode project is using the *.pte and *.model files outputted from the ExecuTorch process. The app is able to run the LLM on device and generate text from the model.
