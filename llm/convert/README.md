# ExecuTorch

This package contains the code for the ExecuTorch project, which is utilized to convert a language model into an executatable format for mobile devices.

First we download the model from the Hugging Face model hub. We run the conversion script to convert the model into a format that can be run on mobile devices. We then integrate the model into an iOS app and the tokenizer as is.
